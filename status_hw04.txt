1. What's your name?
Linus Birkenes

2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.skyflume.com

https://github.com/birkenesl/cs4550-hw04

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
Everything except for the calculator.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
That depends on when you read this - I am currently working on fixing a unique problem preventing me
from starting my hw04 service. I was able to deploy using deploy.sh but obviously cannot keep the server 
continuously up.

Comfortable enough with the basics, although clearly I'm not comfortable enough to implement
expression evaluation.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Calculator + deploying + systemd script
